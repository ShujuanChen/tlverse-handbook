Scientific research is at a unique point in its history. The need to improve
rigor and reproducibility in our field is greater than ever; corroboration moves
science forward, yet there is growing alarm that results cannot be reproduced or
validated, suggesting the possibility that many discoveries may be false
[@baker2016there]. Consequences of not meeting this need will result in further
decline in the rate of scientific progress, the reputation of the sciences, and
the public's trust in scientific findings [@munafo2017manifesto;
@naturenews2_2015].

Unfortunately, in its current state, the culture of statistical data analysis
enables, rather than precludes, the manner in which human bias may affect the
results of (ideally objective) data analytic efforts. A significant degree of
human bias enters statistical analysis efforts in the form improper model
selection. All procedures for estimation and hypothesis testing are derived
based on a choice of statistical model; thus, obtaining valid estimates and
statistical inference relies critically on the chosen statistical model
containing an accurate representation of the process that generated the data.
Consider, for example, a hypothetical study in which a treatment was assigned to
a group of patients: Was the treatment assigned randomly or were characteristics
of the individuals (i.e., baseline covariates) used in making the treatment
decision? Such knowledge can should be incorporated in the statistical model.
Alternatively, the data could be from an observational study, in which there is
no control over the treatment assignment mechanism. In such cases, available
knowledge about the data-generating process (DGP) is more limited still.  If
this is the case, then the statistical model should contain *all* possible
distributions of the data. In practice, however, models are not selected based
on scientific knowledge available
about the DGP; instead, models are often selected based on (1) the philosophical
leanings of the analyst, (2)
the relative convenience of implementation of statistical methods admissible
within the choice of model, and (3) the results of significance testing (i.e.,
p-values) applied within the choice of model.

This practice of "cargo-cult statistics --- the ritualistic miming of statistics
rather than conscientious practice," [@stark2018cargo] is characterized by
arbitrary modeling choices, even though these choices often result in different
answers to the same research question.  That is, "increasingly often,
[statistics] is used instead to aid and abet weak science, a role it can perform
well when used mechanically or ritually," as opposed to its original purpose of
safeguarding against weak science by providing formal techniques for evaluating
the veracity of a claim using properly collected data [@stark2018cargo]. This
presents a fundamental drive behind the epidemic of false findings from which
scientific research is suffering [@vdl2014entering].

Our team at the University of California, Berkeley is uniquely positioned to
provide such an education. Spearheaded by Professor Mark van der Laan, and
spreading rapidly by many of his students and colleagues who have greatly
enriched the field, the aptly named "Targeted Learning" methodology emphasizes a
focus of (i.e., "targeting of") the scientific question at hand, running counter
to the current culture problem of "convenience statistics," which opens the door
to biased estimation, misleading analytic results, and erroneous discoveries.
Targeted Learning embraces the fundamentals that formalized the field of
statistics,


such as the that facts that a statistical
model represents real knowledge about the experiment that generated the data,
and a target parameter represents what we are seeking to learn from the data as
a feature of the distribution that generated it [@vdl2014entering]. In this way,
Targeted Learning defines a truth and establishes a principled standard for
estimation, thereby inhibiting these all-too-human biases (e.g., hindsight bias,
confirmation bias, and outcome bias) from infiltrating analysis.

The objective for this handbook is to provide training to students, researchers,
industry professionals, faculty in science, public health, statistics, and other
fields to empower them with the necessary knowledge and skills to utilize the
sound methodology of Targeted Learning --- a technique that provides tailored
pre-specified machines for answering queries, so that each data analysis is
completely reproducible, and estimators are efficient, minimally biased, and
provide formal statistical inference.

Just as the conscientious use of modern statistical methodology is necessary to
ensure that scientific practice thrives, it remains critical to acknowledge the
role that robust software plays in allowing practitioners direct access to
published results. We recall that "an article...in a scientific publication is
not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The
actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the
complete set of instructions which generated the figures," thus making the
availability and adoption of robust statistical software key to enhancing the
transparency that is an inherent aspect of science [@buckheit1995wavelab].

For a statistical methodology to be readily accessible in practice, it is
crucial that it is accompanied by robust user-friendly software
[@pullenayegum2016knowledge; @stromberg2004write]. The `tlverse` software
ecosystem was developed to fulfill this need for the Targeted Learning
methodology. Not only does this software facilitate computationally reproducible
and efficient analyses, it is also a tool for Targeted Learning education since
its workflow mirrors that of the methodology. In particular, the `tlverse`
paradigm does not focus on implementing a specific estimator or a small set of
related estimators. Instead, the focus is on exposing the statistical framework
of Targeted Learning itself --- all `R` packages in the `tlverse` ecosystem
directly model the key objects defined in the mathematical and theoretical
framework of Targeted Learning. What's more, the `tlverse` `R` packages share a
core set of design principles centered on extensibility, allowing for them to be
used in conjunction with each other and built upon one other in a cohesive
fashion. For an introduction to Targeted Learning, we recommend the [recent
review paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07333) from @coyle2021targeted.

In this handbook, the reader will embark on a journey through the `tlverse`
ecosystem. Guided by `R` programming exercises, case studies, and
intuitive explanation readers will build a toolbox for applying the Targeted
Learning statistical methodology, which will translate to real-world causal
inference analyses. Some preliminaries are required prior to this learning
endeavor -- we have made available a list of [recommended learning
resources](#learn).
