## About this book {-}

*The Hitchhiker's Guide to the `tlverse`, or a Targeted Learning Practitioner's
Handbook* is an open-source and fully-reproducible electronic handbook for
applying the targeted learning methodology in practice using the [`tlverse`
software ecosystem](https://github.com/tlverse). This work is currently in an
early draft phase and is available to facilitate input from the community. To
view or contribute to the available content, consider visiting the
[GitHub repository for this site](https://github.com/tlverse/tlverse-handbook).

## Who is this book for? {-}

## Outline {-}

The contents of this handbook are meant to serve as a reference guide for
applied research as well as materials that can be taught in a series of short
courses focused on the applications of Targeted Learning. Each section
introduces a set of distinct causal questions, motivated by a case study,
alongside statistical methodology and software for assessing the causal claim of
interest. The (evolving) set of materials includes

* Motivation: [Why we need a statistical
    revolution](https://senseaboutscienceusa.org/super-learning-and-the-revolution-in-knowledge/)
* The Roadmap and introductory case study: the WASH Beneifits data
* Introduction to the [`tlverse` software
    ecosystem](https://tlverse.org)
* Ensemble machine learning with the
    [`sl3`](https://github.com/tlverse/sl3) package
* Targeted learning for causal inference with the
    [`tmle3`](https://github.com/tlverse/tmle3) package
* Optimal treatments regimes and the
    [`tmle3mopttx`](https://github.com/tlverse/tmle3mopttx) package
* Stochastic treatment regimes and the
    [`tmle3shift`](https://github.com/tlverse/tmle3shift) package
* _Coda_: [Why we need a statistical
    revolution](https://senseaboutscienceusa.org/super-learning-and-the-revolution-in-knowledge/)

## What this book is not {-}

The focus of this work is __not__ on providing in-depth technical descriptions
of current statistical methodology or recent advancements. Instead, the goal is
to convey key details of state-of-the-art techniques in an manner that is both
clear and complete, without burdening the reader with extraneous information.
We hope that the presentations herein will serve as references for researchers
-- methodologists and domain specialists alike -- that empower them to deploy
the central tools of Targeted Learning in an efficient manner. For technical
details and in-depth descriptions of both classical theory and recent advances
in the field of Targeted Learning, the interested reader is invited to consult
@vdl2011targeted and/or @vdl2018targeted as appropriate. The primary literature
in statistical causal inference, machine learning, and non/semiparametric theory
include many of the most recent advances in Targeted Learning and related areas.

## About the authors {-}

### Jeremy Coyle {-}

Jeremy R. Coyle, Ph.D., is a consulting data scientist and statistical
programmer, currently leading the software development effort that has produced
the `tlverse` ecosystem of R packages and related software tools. Jeremy earned
his Ph.D. in Biostatistics from UC Berkeley in 2016, primarily under the
supervision of Alan Hubbard.

### Nima Hejazi {-}

Nima S. Hejazi is a Ph.D. candidate in biostatistics with a designated emphasis
in computational and genomic biology, working jointly with Mark van der Laan and
Alan Hubbard. Nima is affiliated with UC Berkeley's Center for Computational
Biology and NIH Biomedical Big Data training program. His research interests
span causal inference, nonparametric inference and machine learning, targeted
loss-based estimation, survival analysis, statistical computing, reproducible
research, and high-dimensional biology. He is also passionate about software
development for applied statistics, including software design, automated
testing, and reproducible coding practices. For more information, see
https://nimahejazi.org.

### Ivana Malenica {-}

Ivana Malenica is a Ph.D. student in biostatistics advised by Mark van der Laan.
Ivana is currently a fellow at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, after
serving as a NIH Biomedical Big Data and Freeport-McMoRan Genomic Engine fellow.
She earned her Master's in Biostatistics and Bachelor's in Mathematics, and
spent some time at the Translational Genomics Research Institute. Very broadly,
her research interests span non/semi-parametric theory, probability theory,
machine learning, causal inference and high-dimensional statistics. Most of her
current work involves complex dependent settings (dependence through time and
network) and adaptive sequential designs.

### Rachael Phillips {-}

Rachael V. Phillips is a Ph.D. student in biostatistics, advised by Alan Hubbard
and Mark van der Laan. She has an M.A. in Biostatistics, B.S. in Biology with a
Chemistry minor and a B.A. in Mathematics with a Spanish minor. Rachael is
motivated to solve real-world, high-dimensional problems in human health. Her
research interests span causal inference, machine learning, nonparametric
statistical estimation, and finite sample inference. She is also passionate
about online mediated education. Rachael is affiliated with UC Berkeley's Center
for Computational Biology, NIH Biomedical Big Data Training Program, and
Superfund Research Program.

### Alan Hubbard {-}

Alan E. Hubbard is Professor of Biostatistics, former head of the Division of
Biostatistics at UC Berkeley, and head of data analytics core at UC Berkeley's
SuperFund research program. His current research interests include causal
inference, variable importance analysis, statistical machine learning,
estimation of and inference for data-adaptive statistical target parameters, and
targeted minimum loss-based estimation. Research in his group is generally
motivated by applications to problems in computational biology, epidemiology,
and precision medicine.

### Mark van der Laan {-}

Mark J. van der Laan, PhD, is Professor of Biostatistics and Statistics at UC
Berkeley. His research interests include statistical methods in computational
biology, survival analysis, censored data, adaptive designs, targeted maximum
likelihood estimation, causal inference, data-adaptive loss-based learning, and
multiple testing. His research group developed loss-based super learning in
semiparametric models, based on cross-validation, as a generic optimal tool for
the estimation of infinite-dimensional parameters, such as nonparametric density
estimation and prediction with both censored and uncensored data. Building on
this work, his research group developed targeted maximum likelihood estimation
for a target parameter of the data-generating distribution in arbitrary
semiparametric and nonparametric models, as a generic optimal methodology for
statistical and causal inference. Most recently, Mark's group has focused in
part on the development of a centralized, principled set of software tools for
targeted learning, the `tlverse`. For more information, see

## Recommended Learning Resources {#learn}

To effectively utilize this handbook, the reader need not be a fully trained
statistician to begin understanding and applying these methods. However, it is
highly recommended for the reader to have an understanding of basic statistical
concepts such as confounding, probability distributions, confidence intervals,
hypothesis tests, and regression. Advanced knowledge of mathematical statistics
may be useful but is not necessary. Familiarity with the `R` programming
language will be essential. We also recommend an understanding of introductory
causal inference.

For learning the `R` programming language we recommend the following (free)
introductory resources:

* [Software Carpentry's _Programming with
    `R`_](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)
* [Software Carpentry's _`R` for Reproducible Scientific
    Analysis_](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/)
* [Garret Grolemund and Hadley Wickham's _`R` for Data
    Science_](https://r4ds.had.co.nz)

For a general introduction to causal inference, we recommend

* [Miguel A. Hernán and James M. Robins' _Causal Inference_, forthcoming
    2019](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/)
* [Jason A. Roy's _A Crash Course in Causality: Inferring Causal Effects from
    Observational Data_ on
