## Outline {-}

The contents of this handbook are meant to serve as a reference guide for
applied research as well as materials that can be taught in a series of short
courses focused on the applications of Targeted Learning. Each section
introduces a set of distinct causal questions, motivated by a case study,
alongside statistical methodology and software for assessing the causal claim of
interest. The (evolving) set of materials includes

* Motivation: [Why we need a statistical
    revolution](https://senseaboutscienceusa.org/super-learning-and-the-revolution-in-knowledge/)
* The Roadmap and introductory case study: the WASH Benefits Bangladesh dataset
* Introduction to the [`tlverse` software
    ecosystem](https://tlverse.org)
* Cross-validation with the [`origami`](https://github.com/tlverse/origami)
    package
* Ensemble machine learning with the
    [`sl3`](https://github.com/tlverse/sl3) package
* Targeted learning for causal inference with the
    [`tmle3`](https://github.com/tlverse/tmle3) package
* Optimal treatments regimes and the
    [`tmle3mopttx`](https://github.com/tlverse/tmle3mopttx) package
* Stochastic treatment regimes and the
    [`tmle3shift`](https://github.com/tlverse/tmle3shift) package
* Causal mediation analysis with the
    [`tmle3mediate`](https://github.com/tlverse/tmle3mediate) package
* _Coda_: [Why we need a statistical
    revolution](https://senseaboutscienceusa.org/super-learning-and-the-revolution-in-knowledge/)

## What this book is not {-}

The focus of this work is __not__ on providing in-depth technical descriptions
of current statistical methodology or recent advancements. Instead, the goal is
to convey key details of state-of-the-art techniques in an manner that is both
clear and complete, without burdening the reader with extraneous information.
We hope that the presentations herein will serve as references for researchers
-- methodologists and domain specialists alike -- that empower them to deploy
the central tools of Targeted Learning in an efficient manner. For technical
details and in-depth descriptions of both classical theory and recent advances
in the field of Targeted Learning, the interested reader is invited to consult
@vdl2011targeted and/or @vdl2018targeted as appropriate. The primary literature
in statistical causal inference, machine learning, and non/semiparametric theory
include many of the most recent advances in Targeted Learning and related areas.

## About the authors {-}

### Mark van der Laan {-}

Mark van der Laan, PhD, is Professor of Biostatistics and Statistics at UC
Berkeley and co-director of UC Berkeley's [Center for Targeted Machine Learning
and Causal Inference](https://ctml.berkeley.edu/). His research interests
include statistical methods in computational biology, survival analysis,
censored data, adaptive designs, targeted maximum likelihood estimation, causal
inference, data-adaptive loss-based learning, and multiple testing. His research
group developed loss-based super learning in semiparametric models, based on
cross-validation, as a generic optimal tool for the estimation of
infinite-dimensional parameters, such as nonparametric density estimation and
prediction with both censored and uncensored data. Building on this work, his
research group developed targeted maximum likelihood estimation for a target
parameter of the data-generating distribution in arbitrary semiparametric and
nonparametric models, as a generic optimal methodology for statistical and
causal inference. Since mid-2017, Mark's group has focused in part on the
development of a centralized, principled set of software tools for targeted
learning, the `tlverse`.

### Jeremy Coyle {-}

Jeremy Coyle, PhD, is a consulting data scientist and statistical programmer,
currently leading the software development effort that has produced the
`tlverse` ecosystem of R packages and related software tools. Jeremy earned his
PhD in Biostatistics from UC Berkeley in 2017, primarily under the supervision
of Alan Hubbard.

### Nima Hejazi {-}

[Nima Hejazi](https://nimahejazi.org), PhD, is an incoming Assistant Professor
of Biostatistics at the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public
Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/). He received his PhD in
biostatistics at UC Berkeley, working under the supervision of Mark van der Laan
and Alan Hubbard, and afterwards held an NSF postdoctoral research fellowship.
Nima's research interests blend causal inference, machine learning,
semiparametric estimation, and computational statistics -- areas of recent
emphasis include causal mediation analysis, efficiency under biased sampling
designs, non/semi-parametric sieve estimation with machine learning, and
targeted loss-based estimation. His work is primarily driven by applications in
clinical trials (esp. vaccine efficacy trials), infectious disease epidemiology,
and computational biology. Nima is passionate about statistical computing
and open source software design standards for statistical data science, and he
has co-led or contributed significantly to many `tlverse` packages (`hal9001`,
`sl3`, `tmle3`, `origami`, `tmle3shift`, `tmle3mediate`).

### Ivana Malenica {-}

Ivana Malenica is a PhD student in biostatistics advised by Mark van der Laan.
Ivana is currently a fellow at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, after
serving as a NIH Biomedical Big Data and Freeport-McMoRan Genomic Engine fellow.
She earned her Master's in Biostatistics and Bachelor's in Mathematics, and
spent some time at the Translational Genomics Research Institute. Very broadly,
her research interests span non/semi-parametric theory, probability theory,
machine learning, causal inference and high-dimensional statistics. Most of her
current work involves complex dependent settings (dependence through time and
network) and adaptive sequential designs.

### Rachael Phillips {-}

Rachael Phillips is a PhD student in biostatistics, advised by Alan Hubbard and
Mark van der Laan. She has an MA in Biostatistics, BS in Biology, and BA in
Mathematics. As a student of targeted learning, Rachael integrates causal 
inference, machine learning, and statistical theory to answer causal questions 
with statistical confidence. She is motivated by issues arising in healthcare, 
and is especially interested in clinical algorithm frameworks and guidelines. 
Related to to this, she is also interested in experimental design; 
human-computer interaction; statistical analysis pre-specification, automation, 
and reproducibility; and open-source software.

### Alan Hubbard {-}

Alan Hubbard, PhD, is Professor of Biostatistics at UC Berkeley, current chair
of the Division of Biostatistics of the UC Berkeley School of Public Health,
head of the data analytics core of UC Berkeley's SuperFund research program, and
co-director of UC Berkeley's [Center for Targeted Machine Learning and Causal
Inference](https://ctml.berkeley.edu/). His current research interests include
causal inference, variable importance analysis, statistical machine learning,
estimation of and inference for data-adaptive statistical target parameters, and
targeted minimum loss-based estimation. Research in his group is generally
motivated by applications to problems in computational biology, epidemiology,
and precision medicine.

## Reproduciblity {-}

The `tlverse` software ecosystem is a growing collection of packages, several of
which are quite early on in the software lifecycle. The team does its best to
maintain backwards compatibility. Once this work reaches completion, the
specific versions of the `tlverse` packages used will be archived and tagged to
produce it.

This book was written using [bookdown](http://bookdown.org/), and the complete
source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tlverse/tlverse-handbook).
This version of the book was built with `r R.version.string`,
[pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) version `r rmarkdown::pandoc_version()`, and the
following packages:

```{r pkg-list, echo = FALSE, results="asis"}
# borrowed from https://github.com/tidymodels/TMwR/blob/master/index.Rmd
deps <- desc::desc_get_deps()
pkgs <- sort(deps$package[deps$type == "Imports"])
pkgs <- sessioninfo::package_info(pkgs, dependencies = FALSE)
df <- tibble::tibble(
  package = pkgs$package,
  version = pkgs$ondiskversion,
  source = gsub("@", "\\\\@", pkgs$source)
)
knitr::kable(df, format = "markdown")
```

## Learning resources {-}

To effectively utilize this handbook, the reader need not be a fully trained
statistician to begin understanding and applying these methods. However, it is
highly recommended for the reader to have an understanding of basic statistical
concepts such as confounding, probability distributions, confidence intervals,
hypothesis tests, and regression. Advanced knowledge of mathematical statistics
may be useful but is not necessary. Familiarity with the `R` programming
language will be essential. We also recommend an understanding of introductory
causal inference.

For learning the `R` programming language we recommend the following (free)
introductory resources:

* [Software Carpentry's _Programming with
    `R`_](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)
* [Software Carpentry's _`R` for Reproducible Scientific
    Analysis_](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/)
* [Garret Grolemund and Hadley Wickham's _`R` for Data
    Science_](https://r4ds.had.co.nz)

For a general introduction to causal inference, we recommend

* [Miguel A. Hernán and James M. Robins' _Causal Inference: What If_,
    2021](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/)
* [Jason A. Roy's _A Crash Course in Causality: Inferring Causal Effects from
  Observational Data_ on
  Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crash-course-in-causality)
