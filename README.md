Welcome to the GitHub repository for drafts of [**Targeted Learning in `R`:
A Causal Data Science Handbook**](http://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook), by Mark
van der Laan, Jeremy Coyle, Nima Hejazi, Ivana Malenica, Rachael Phillips, and
Alan Hubbard. This draft is work-in-progress and updates are made available
frequently. The draft has been made publicly available in order to solicit
feedback (and errata) transparently from the interested community. The book is
built using RStudio's
[`bookdown`](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/introducing-bookdown/)
`R` package; see [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/) for more information on
how to use `bookdown`. The online book is automatically built and deployed via
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and served to
https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook by [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
