[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tlverse/tlverse-handbook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tlverse/tlverse-handbook)
Note: `travis-ci` currently deploys the developmental version of this workshop
handbook into the `gh-pages` branch of this repository, which is hosted by
GitHub Pages at https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook.

Welcome to the GitHub repository for an early draft of [**The Hitchhiker's
Guide to the `tlverse`, or a Targeted Learning Practitioner's
Handbook**](http://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook), by Mark van der Laan, Alan
Hubbard, Jeremy Coyle, Nima Hejazi, Ivana Malenica, and Rachael Phillips. This
is very much a work-in-progress and updates are made available frequently.

This workshop handbook is built using RStudio's
[`bookdown`](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/introducing-bookdown/)
package; for more information on how to use `bookdown` see
[bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/).
