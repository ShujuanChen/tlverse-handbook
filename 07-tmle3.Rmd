# The TMLE Framework {#tmle3}

## Learning Objectives {#learn-tmle}

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to

1. Understand why we use TMLE for effect estimation.
2. Use `tmle3` to estimate an Average Treatment Effect (ATE).
3. Understand how to use `tmle3` "Specs" objects.
4. Fit `tmle3` for a custom set of target parameters.
5. Use the delta method to estimate transformations of target parameters.


## Roadmap Review
## We want to estimate psi better
## We also want inference
## schematic example
## washb example
## advanced usage
